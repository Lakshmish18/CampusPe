Name: Lakshmish M Devadiga

Questions Attempted:
I have attempted all 20 questions in the assignment.

Special Instructions:
- All programs have been written using basic concepts of Python.
- Functions have been used wherever necessary.
- Conditional statements have been used more
- Exception handling has been used wherever necessary in programs requiring input validation.
- The code has been written in a simple and readable human language.

Challenges Encountered:
- At first, I heavily depended on exception handling without considering other logical ways of doing things.
- I realized that I heavily depended on conditional statements without considering other ways of doing things, such as dictionary mapping or other structured methods.
- In Question 20 (Number System Functions), I did not immediately understand the built-in functions for conversion.
- I referred to online tutorials to understand how built-in functions like bin(), oct(), hex(), and int() with base conversion work.
- After gaining understanding, I wrote the program correctly.
Overall Learning:
This assignment has improved my knowledge of functions, loops, conditionals,
